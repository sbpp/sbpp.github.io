please make sure your host allows remote connections This problem is often related to user accounts that the server permits View MariaDB Granting for more info Cant connect to MySQL server Normally means that there is no MySQL server running on the system or that you are using an incorrect Unix socket file name or TCPIP port number when trying to connect to the server You should also check that the TCPIP port you are using has not been blocked by a firewall or port blocking service A MySQL client on Unix can connect to the mysqld server in two different ways By using a Unix socket file to connect through a file in the file system default tmpmysqlsock or by using TCPIP which connects through a port number Lost connection to MySQL server Most commonly due to bindaddress not commented out view MariaDB Configuring for more info It may also indicate network connectivity trouble and you should check the condition of your network if this error occurs frequently If the error message includes during query this is probably the case you are experiencing More rarely it can happen when the client is attempting the initial connection to the server In this case if your connecttimeout value is set to only a few seconds you may be able to resolve the problem by increasing it to ten seconds perhaps more if you have a very long distance or slow connection MySQL server has gone away The most common reason for the MySQL server has gone away error is that the server timed out and closed the connection In this case you normally get one of the following error codes which one you get is operating systemdependent Error Code Description CRSERVERGONEERROR The client couldnt send a question to the server CRSERVERLOST The client didnt get an error when writing to the server but it didnt get a full answer or any answer to the question Other common reasons If you send a query to the server that is incorrect or too large If mysqld receives a packet that is too large or out of order it assumes that something has gone wrong with the client and closes the connection If you need big queries for example if you are working with big BLOB columns you can increase the query limit by setting the servers maxallowedpacket variable which has a default value of 4MB You may also need to increase the maximum packet size on the client end Too many connections This means that all available connections are in use by other clients This problem occurs commonly on shared hosting where you are granted the most minimal resources The number of connections permitted is controlled by the maxconnections system variable Table doesnt exist As the error may hint the table does not exist which might suggest your installation is corrupted"},{"title":"Debugging
